#### 1.5 Materialized Views

Materialized views are a specialized type of database object in PostgreSQL that stores the result of a query as a physical table. Unlike standard views, which are virtual and execute the underlying query each time they are queried, materialized views are precomputed and store the result, making data retrieval faster but requiring periodic refreshes to keep the data up-to-date. Materialized views are particularly useful in scenarios where you need to balance query performance and data currency. Here's a detailed look at materialized views:

##### 1.5.1 Creating Materialized Views

To create a materialized view, you use the `MATERIALIZED VIEW` keyword in PostgreSQL. You define the query that populates the materialized view, and PostgreSQL stores the result as a physical table.

```sql
-- Creating a materialized view
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales AS
SELECT date_trunc('month', order_date) as month, SUM(total_amount) as total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY month;
```

##### 1.5.2 Query Performance

Materialized views are designed to significantly enhance query performance, particularly for complex and resource-intensive aggregations or joins. Instead of computing these operations on the fly, applications can query the materialized view directly, providing rapid access to aggregated or transformed data.

```sql
-- Querying a materialized view
SELECT * FROM monthly_sales WHERE month >= '2023-01-01';
```

##### 1.5.3 Data Refresh

The key consideration with materialized views is data refresh. Unlike standard views that always reflect the current state of the database, materialized views store a snapshot of the data at the time of their last refresh. To keep the data current, you need to periodically refresh the materialized view, which can be done manually or automatically.

- **Manual Refresh**: You can manually refresh a materialized view using the `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command. This gives you full control over when and how often the data is updated.

- **Automatic Refresh**: PostgreSQL allows you to configure automatic refresh for materialized views using triggers, rules, or scheduled jobs. Automatic refresh ensures that the data remains up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.

```sql
-- Manual refresh of a materialized view
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales;

-- Automatic refresh using a trigger
-- Example of a trigger to refresh the materialized view after data changes
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_monthly_sales()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS
$$
BEGIN
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER refresh_monthly_sales_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON orders
FOR EACH STATEMENT
EXECUTE FUNCTION refresh_monthly_sales();
```

##### 1.5.4 Use Cases

Materialized views are ideal for scenarios where you need to balance query performance with data currency. Common use cases include:

- **Frequently Accessed Aggregations**: Storing precomputed aggregations like monthly sales, average scores, or counts in materialized views can accelerate reporting and analytical queries.

- **Complex Joins and Data Transformations**: Materialized views simplify queries that involve complex joins across multiple tables or data transformations.

- **Data Warehousing**: In data warehousing scenarios, materialized views can be used to store and access pre-aggregated and summarized data efficiently.

- **Caching Results**: Materialized views can act as a caching layer for frequently queried and computationally expensive data, reducing the load on the database.

##### 1.5.5 Best Practices

When working with materialized views, consider the following best practices:

- Document the purpose of each materialized view and the refresh strategy.
- Balance the frequency of refresh with the application's data currency requirements.
- Monitor materialized view refresh processes to ensure they complete in a reasonable time frame.
- Keep track of the storage requirements, as materialized views consume storage space.

Materialized views are a powerful tool in PostgreSQL for optimizing query performance and managing complex data structures. By using them effectively and planning for regular data refresh, you can create a more responsive and efficient database system.
