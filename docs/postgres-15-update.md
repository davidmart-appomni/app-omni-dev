## Postgres 15 Update (from 9.6)

1. **Performance Improvements:**<br />
  PostgreSQL 15 comes with various performance enhancements, making it faster and more efficient than version 9.6. There have been improvements in query execution, indexing, and parallel processing.

      - **Query Execution Speed:** <br/>
        PostgreSQL 15 includes improvements in query execution. It optimizes the execution of complex queries, making them run faster. This is achieved through various query planner and executor enhancements.

      - **Indexing Enhancements:** <br/> 
        Indexes are crucial for speeding up database queries. PostgreSQL 15 introduces optimizations in the way it manages and utilizes indexes, which can lead to faster query performance, especially for read-heavy workloads.

      - **Parallel Processing:** <br/> 
        Parallel processing has been improved in PostgreSQL 15. This means that the database can better utilize multi-core processors, distributing the workload more efficiently across available CPU cores. Queries that can be parallelized benefit from this enhancement.

      - **Partitioning Performance:** <br/> 
        Partitioning is a technique used to manage large tables by breaking them into smaller, more manageable pieces. PostgreSQL 15's improvements in partitioning result in better query performance when working with partitioned tables.

      - **B-tree Deduplication:** <br/> 
        PostgreSQL 15 introduces a new B-tree deduplication feature. B-tree indexes are widely used in PostgreSQL, and this feature helps reduce the storage and maintenance costs associated with these indexes. It can lead to better performance, particularly in terms of index maintenance.

      - **Auto-Vacuuming Enhancements:** <br/> 
        Auto-vacuum is a critical background process in PostgreSQL responsible for reclaiming dead rows and maintaining the health of the database. Performance improvements in auto-vacuum can reduce the impact of maintenance tasks on the overall system performance.

      - **Enhanced Data Types:** <br/> 
        PostgreSQL 15 brings improvements to data types like JSON and JSONB. These enhancements can lead to better performance when working with JSON data, which is becoming increasingly common in modern applications.

      - **Optimizer Improvements:** <br/> 
        The query optimizer in PostgreSQL has been refined in version 15, which can lead to more efficient query plans. It can better estimate the cost of different query plans and choose the most optimal execution strategy.

      - **Better Resource Management:** <br/> 
        PostgreSQL 15 has improved resource management, which helps prevent resource contention and bottlenecks. This means that the database can handle high loads more efficiently.

      - **Reduced Lock Contention:**
 <br/> 
  Improved lock management and reduced lock contention can lead to better concurrent performance, allowing multiple transactions to work more smoothly in parallel.

2. **Partitioning Improvements:**<br />
  PostgreSQL 15 offers more advanced and efficient partitioning features compared to version 9.6. It includes declarative partitioning, which simplifies the management of partitioned tables.

3. **Better Parallelism:**<br />
  PostgreSQL 15 has improved parallel processing capabilities, allowing for better utilization of multi-core processors. This results in faster query execution for parallelizable queries.

4. **Security Enhancements:**<br />
  PostgreSQL 15 includes improved security features and better default settings for security. It's essential to keep your database secure, and the newer version has updates to help with that.

5. **JSON and JSONB Improvements:**<br />
  JSON and JSONB data types have seen improvements in terms of performance and capabilities. These improvements enhance the handling of JSON data in PostgreSQL 15.

6. **B-tree Index Enhancements:**<br />
  PostgreSQL 15 introduces a new B-tree deduplication feature, which helps reduce storage and maintenance costs for B-tree indexes.
