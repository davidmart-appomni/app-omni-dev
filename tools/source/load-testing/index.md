## Load Testing

1. [**Database Replay**](/tools/load-testing/1-database-replay.md): Record and replay actual production workloads on the replica database to simulate real-world usage patterns.

1. **Workload Generator Tools**: Use workload generation tools like HammerDB, Apache JMeter, or Gatling to simulate user interactions and test the replica's response under load.

1. **Data Generation Tools**: Create realistic test data using data generation tools to mimic production data volume and diversity.

1. **Stress Testing**: Intentionally overload the replica database with more queries and connections than it can handle to assess its performance under extreme conditions.

1. **Concurrency Testing**: Evaluate the database's ability to handle multiple concurrent connections and transactions, which can help uncover deadlocks and contention issues.
